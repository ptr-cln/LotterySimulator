# LotterySimulator

Hello! Are you a gambler? Good for you!
Here is a lottery simulator that helps you to understand how many probabilities you have for earning with these gambling games.

The script is written in Python3, it lets you choose some numbers (from 1 number to 10 numbers) and then he generates 20 random numbers for X times (10000 by default).
Finally, it generates a file (ExtractionsSummary.txt) with a summary of how many times and with how many numbers you have guessed.

You can launch this script by "LotterySimulatorMain.py" (Without GUI).
You can also launch this script by "LotterySimulatorTkinter.py" (With a simple GUI):
