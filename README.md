# LotterySimulator

Hello! Are you a <b>gambler</b>? Good for you!<br>
Here is a lottery simulator that helps you to understand how many probabilities you have for earning with these gambling games.<br>

The script is written in Python3, it lets you choose some numbers (from 1 number to 10 numbers) and then he generates 20 random numbers for X times (10000 by default).<br>
Finally, it generates a file (ExtractionsSummary.txt) with a summary of how many times and with how many numbers you have guessed.

You can launch this script by <b>"LotterySimulatorMain.py"</b> (<b>Without</b> GUI).<br>
You can also launch this script by <b>"LotterySimulatorTkinter.py"</b> (<b>With</b> a simple GUI):<br>
