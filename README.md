# LotterySimulator
Hello! Are you a gambler? Good for you!
Here is a lottery simulator that help you to understand how many probabilities you have for earning with these gamble games.

The script is written in Python3, it let you choose some numbers (from 1 to 10) and then he generates 20 random numbers for X times (10000 by default).
Finally it generates a file (Winnings_Summary.txt) with a summary of how many times and with how many numbers you have guessed.

Launch "LotterySimulatorMain.py" and ... Good Luck :)
